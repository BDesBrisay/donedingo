# Homework 3 Checkpoint
Bryce DesBrisay
Oct 18th

### Proposed Plan:
1. React frontend setup running locally
2. Routes created (and buttons on each to navigate throughout site)
3. Each page with its css module stylesheet file
4. If there is time, basic layout of dashboard (3 columns with labels)

### What I Accomplished:
1. React frontend project is set up
2. All routes created and have links to others (Landing, Dashboard, Profile)
3. Each page has a module.css file attached to it
4. Basic three column layout on the dashboard
5. Name, logo, and favicon added

### Plan for Next Deadline (Nov 8):
1. Firebase Auth set up
2. Protected auth routes
3. Profile info displayed
4. Firebase DB project setup in the firebase console
5. Basic UI elements on dashboard (inputs and buttons, no functionality)
