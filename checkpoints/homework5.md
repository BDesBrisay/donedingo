### Proposed Plan:
1. Functional dashboard item inputs (for each: objective, key-result, task)
2. CRUD DB actions for each dashboard item
3. Basic interface objects for each dashboard item

### What I Accomplished:
1.  Styled, functional item inputs + modal
2.  CR (create, read) DB Actions for each dashboard item
3.  Basic interface items + style for Goals and Plans (Not Tasks)
4.  Styled dashboard interface

### Plan for Next Deadline (Nov 22):
1.  Delete and Update functionality for dashboard items
2.  Unit tests for each DB action
3.  Style profile page and add in basic stats
4.  Add stats to main dashboard items
